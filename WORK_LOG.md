My first thought was bfs and a trie so I added my trie class from spellcheck. |

Dfs is better than bfs in this case because dfs will go through one path entirely at a time rather than having to backtrack to go through all neighboring letters with bfs. With dfs we can also utilize a recursive method and can potentially stop going through certain paths if they don't fit known prefixes. Since I know there needs to be an array to store points already visited I made a 2d array of booleans the size of the board to work as a map. Then I made a dfs method that will be called recursively I also added a base case of if we have already being somewhere before using the visited map and add some pseudocode. |

I made a trie and added all of the words form the dictionary to it dictionary. The I added two for loops to traverse the board and called my dfs method within the for loops. I also made a 2d array of booleans to act as my map of visited locations on the board. |
| Jan 13  | 11:30 - 12:00 |  I finished my dfs method. First I added checking boundaries to the base case. The the method moves to the next trie node and adds the current character to the prefix. Original I forgot to update the root by getting the next node. The the method checks if the prefix of the current path is in the dictionary to allow the method to potentially end early which is one of the benefits of using dfs in this problemset. Then if the word is in the dictionary it is add to the goodwords the location on the map of the board is set as visited and the method is recursively called on all possible directions on the board. That last line I had to added after getting some errors as I forgot to set the visited locations on the map back to false so the other paths could use the locations. Another error I had to go back and fix was handling duplicates as originally I was not doing that so I only passed some checks. To fix this I just added a check to the if stament that checks if a word is in the dictionary to also check if the work is already added to goodwords. |
