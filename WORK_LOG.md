My first thought was bfs and a trie so I added my trie class from spellcheck. |
| Jan 9   |  8:55-9:55   | A trie and bfs was not the most efficient way to solve the problem as using a trie and dfs is better. Dfs is better than bfs in this case because dfs will go through one path entirely at a time rather than having to backtrack to go through all neighboring letters with bfs. With dfs we can also utilize a recursive method and can potentially stop going through certain paths if they don't fit known prefixes. Since I know there needs to be an array to store points already visited I made a 2d array of booleans the size of the board to work as a map. Then I made a dfs method that will be called recursively I also added a base case of if we have already being somewhere before using the visited map and add some pseudocode. |

I added 3 for loops so findwords could traverse the dictionary and the board then compare the  first letter of current location in the dictionary to the current point on the board and if they were the same that location on the map is set to true and recursive dfs begins at that point |
