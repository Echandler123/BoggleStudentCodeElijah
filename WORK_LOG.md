My first thought was bfs and a trie so I added my trie class from spellcheck. |
| Jan 9   |  8:55-9:55   | A trie and bfs was not the most efficient way to solve the problem as using a trie and dfs is better. Dfs is better than bfs in this case because dfs will go through one path entirely at a time rather than having to backtrack to go through all neighboring letters with bfs. With dfs we can also utilize a recursive method and can potentially stop going through certain paths if they don't fit known prefixes. Since I know there needs to be an array to store points already visited I made a 2d array of booleans the size of the board to work as a map. Then I made a dfs method that will be called recursively I also added a base case of if we have already being somewhere before using the visited map and add some pseudocode. |

I made a trie and added all of the words form the dictionary to it dictionary. The I added two for loops to traverse the board and called my dfs method within the for loops. I also made a 2d array of booleans to act as my map of visited locations on the board. |
